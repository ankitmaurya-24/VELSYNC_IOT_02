# Task-02: LED Automation Using IoT (Cloud Controlled LED)

## 📌 Objective
To control an LED remotely using a mobile application using IoT technology.

## 🛠 Tools & Components Used
- ESP32 Development Board
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk IoT App
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- LED + Resistor
- WiFi Network

## ⚙ Working Description
In this project, an LED is controlled using the Blynk IoT mobile application.  
ESP32 connects to the internet using WiFi and receives control commands from the Blynk cloud.  
Based on the command, the LED is turned ON or OFF in real time.

## 🔌 Circuit Setup
- LED connected to GPIO 2 of ESP32 via resistor
- Breadboard used for connections
- Jumper wires for connectivity
- Common GND connection
